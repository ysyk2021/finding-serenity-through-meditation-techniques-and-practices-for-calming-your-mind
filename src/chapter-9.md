To begin a body scan meditation practice, find a quiet and comfortable space to sit or lie down. Start by taking a few deep breaths, focusing on the sensation of the breath moving in and out of the body. Next, systematically scan the body, starting at the top of the head and working down to the toes. As you scan each area, notice any tension or discomfort, and use deep breathing and relaxation techniques to release this tension.
